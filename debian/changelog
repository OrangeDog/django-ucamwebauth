django-ucamwebauth (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * UCAMWEBAUTH_CREATE_USE is now by default True. Empty database with default to False cause automatic redirect to
    log out and very few people will use the False option to only let users in if they are already present in the
    database.
